MySQL users  aren't the same thing as application user
	-Mysql users are users/connections authorized to manipulate the db
	-Scenerio is 3 apps on the same server
		todo, craigslist, dating app
		for the todo app, we'll have a mysql user called todo_user
			GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON todo_db.* TO 'todo_user'$'localhost';

		for the todo app, we'll have a mysql user called craigslist_user
		for the todo app, we'll have a mysql user called dating_user

	Each application should have its own mysql user that only has access to that application's db.

mysql == relational database management system
