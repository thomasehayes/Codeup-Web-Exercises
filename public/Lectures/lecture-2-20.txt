=========DOM (Document Object Model)
helps change the page dynamically with JS

Get reference the DOM by IDs
var id = document.getElementById("some ID");
console.log(id);

Referencing the DOM by Tag Name
var paragraphs = document.getElementByTagNAme("p");
console.log(paragraphs);


//console logs all elements in the collection
for (var i =0; i <paragraphs.length; i++) {
	console.log(i);
}

Referencing the DOM by Class Name
var class = document.getElementsByClassName("classname");
console.log(class);


=========DOM Events
Register event listeners
Remove event listeners

Review/Question

document.getElementByID("shuffle");
HTML element

document.getElementsByClassName("container");
NodeList of HTML elements with that class name

document.getElementsByTagName("div");
NodeList of HTML elements with that HTML tag

NodeList can't forEach

element.addEventListener("click", function()) {
	//whatever code we write inside here
});

<h1 class="orange">Hi everyone</h1>
var OrangeElements = document.getElementsByClassName("orange")[0];
// [0] if you know you have only 1

extra practice
1. create an html page that says hello world
make a button that changes the text to goodbye world
make another button that changes it back

2. make an unordered list of programming topics you know
-assignment
-comparison
-conditionals

make a button next to it that bolds all the text
make another button that un-bolds all the text
make a 3rd button that changes the text to all caps


3. make your hello world page have no background image
add button that adds a background image of rick astley to the body element
make another button that undoes this action.

4. make a button that reverses or flips all the text on your page when click
make another button that reverses this


5. Add a text input w/ a label and placeholder text that asks what your favorite band is
add a button next to it that changes the input's value to say "Rick Astley" when clicked


==============JS Calculator
0. Pick a starting place - look or functionality
1. "Instructions" are specification from a client
2. Read the instructions (carefully, methodically, with an attention to detail)
3. Write out the real world steps that human does with a calculator to get stuff done.
4. Turn this sequence of steps into pseudo-code
	//add event listener to every button
	//when user hits 1, show 1 numeral inside the display
5. Piece by piece, turn each tiny little step into code
