When sorting, if the function has a 'r' in the name before sort, it will sort by descending order, otherwise, it will sort ascending 

if you sort with sort(), rsort(), shuffle(), you will lose the associative keys in the array. 


the 'a' in asort() stands for associative
the 'k' in ksort() stands for keys
