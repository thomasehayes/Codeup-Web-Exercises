var cellPhone = {
	color: "black",
	brand: "iPhone",
	model: "5s",
	storage: "16gb",
	manufactured: "2010",
	carrier: "AT&T",
	locked: true,
	unlocked: function () {
		this.locked = false;         //this. replaces needing to write 								//.cellPhone
	},
	lock: function () {
		this.locked = true;
	}, 
	makeACall: function() {
		return "Making a call.";
