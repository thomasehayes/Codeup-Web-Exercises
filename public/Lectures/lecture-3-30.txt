Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP - Programming with objects and classes

Why OOP 
	- organizing code/data, makes code more DRY - Do Not Repeat yourself
	- Allows for scaling up code
	- Modular easier to pick out pieces to work on
	- Easier to visualize

Class - template - blue print for an object

Object - Product of a class, collection of behaviors and state

Instantiation - Calling the class to make an object

Property - Characteristic  of a class / variable in a class

Method - function in a class 

$this - refers to the instance of a class / object


constructors / Destructors

General Information

Constructor - a method that is automatically called when an object is instantiated.

Destructor - a method that is automatically called when an object is unset or the scripts have completed execution

Both constructors and destructors in PHP are examples of magic methods

Magic Methods - methods in a class that are called "magically" by PHP and not directly in code wirtten by the developer

Syntax in a class

public function __construct() {
	//do something when a new object is instantiated
}

public function __destruct() {
	//do something ... 
}

-- Practical Application --
The constructor is most often used to set default values at the time of object instantiation

The destructor is most often used to execute a shut down sequence to clean up any open resources (e.g. closing a database connection, closing file, etc.)

example 
<?php

public class Test {
	public function __construct() 
	{
		echo "hello";
	}
	public function __destruct() 
	{
		echo "bye";
	}
}
?>

<?php

require_once "";
$testClass = new Test();
// this will show hello and bye

unset($testClass);
var_dump($testClass);
// will get a warning because we unset it


?>
