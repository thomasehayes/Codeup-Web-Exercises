Actions = Statements

If
If/Else
Else if
Comparison Operators
Ternary Operators


If Structure ------

if (condition) {
	action;
}

Else --------------

if (condition) {
	action;
} else {
	action;
}

Else if -----------

if (condition1) {
	action; runs if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2){ runs if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
	action;
} else { runs if condition1 and condition2 is false
	action;
}

Comparison Operators ----------------

Operator	Description
==			equal to (value)
===			equal to (type and value)
!=			not equal to (value)
!==			not equal to (type and value)
>			greater than
<			less than
>=			greater than or equal to
<=			less than or equal to


Ternary Operator (Shorthand If/Else) ---------

(condition) ? returnValueIfTure : returnValueIfFalse;

If Else Exercises:
-Knowing that a student's grades are 70, 80, 95. Write a JS program, using conditionals that logs to the console "You're awesome" if the average of her grades is greater than 80, otherwise the message should be "You need to practice more".
	var highGrades = ((70+80+95)/3);

	if (highGrades > 80) {
		console.log("You're awesome!");
	}	else {
		console.log("You need to practice more.");
	}

or

	var grade1 = 70,
	grade2 = 80,
	grade3 = 95,
	numberOfGrades = 3,
	gradeAverage = (grade1 + grade2 + grade3) / numberOfGrades;

	if (gradeAverage >80) {
		console.log("You're awesome!");
}	else {
	console.log("You need to practice more.");
	}

-HEB has an offer for the clients that buy products amounting more than $200 Write a JS program, using conditionals, that logs to the browser, how much does Ryan, Cameron and George need to pay. We know that Cameron bought $180, Ryan $250 and George $320. Your program will have to display a line with the name of the person, the amount before the discount, if any, and the amount after the discount.
Suppose your friend Isaac cannot decide between two options. He doesn't know if he should buy a car or a new house. Help him decide! Write a small JS program. The following line generates either a 0 or a 1 randomly. A 35% discount should be applied to any amount over $200. Output should look like:"Pam bought $300.00 of groceries. Discount was applied. Final payment: $275.00"



-var flipACoin = Math.floor(Math.random()* 2)
Add an if statement to log a "Buy a car" to the console if the result is 0 and "Buy a house" if the result is 1. Could this program be written using a ternary operator?
	
	var flipACoin = Math.floor(Math.random()*2);

	if (flipACoin === 0) {
		console.log("Buy a car");
	} else {
		console.log("Buy a house");
	} 

	var flipACoin = (flipACoin === 0) ? "Buy a car" : "Buy a house";
	console.log(flipACoin);


While Loops ---------------

While loop lets us run code repeatedly until a condition is met
General Form
while (condition) {
	statements
}

how it executes
1) check condition
	2a) if true, execute the body
		3)go to step 1
	2b) if false, go to the closing curly brace


do-while loop - while loop that will always execute at least once

do{
	statement
} while (condition);

1)execute body
2)check condition
	3a)if true, go to step 1
	3b)if false, carry on
