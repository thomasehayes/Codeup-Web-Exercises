How a page renders in order

1. PHP
2. HTML DOM
3. JS

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller
	M = the data layer of the application
		readsFile

	V = file that shows the data (the presentation layer)
		showsContacts
		like foreach loops
		showing me how the data looks like once the function is ran

	C = provides the glue that brings the Model and View together
		takes the data from the Model and do something
		ex. addContact($filename);
