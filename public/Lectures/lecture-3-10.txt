Loop
- for repetition
- with different data / modifying inside the loop
- they either know when to stop or when to continue

While (condition) { // it might run 0 times
}
	- condition -> when to continue
	- boolean expression -> something that return true/false
	- when to use it?
		- if you probably don't want to repeat the code not even once

do {
	
} white (condition) // it will run at least one time

- Use this when you want to repeat the code at least once
- while - do while -> because you can't count
- for -> because you can count

// counter -> know in advance how many times the code will be repeated
// because you're counting
// for arrays

  //initialization	      //increment
for (var i = 0 ;condition; i++) {
	
}


PHP need this as their file
<?php

?>

Make sure you always use ; to close a statement or it won't work

this is important to remember
$name = "thomas";
**********var_dump("$name");************
it will show the data type of the variable and what it is equaled to.

double vs single quotes
if you use single quotes around a variable, it will come out as a string
if you use double quotes around variables, it will call whatever the variable is set to.
	you can add a string with the variables to display everything as a string.
	echo "My first name is: $fName. My last name is $lName";

concantenating is php uses a dot (.)
