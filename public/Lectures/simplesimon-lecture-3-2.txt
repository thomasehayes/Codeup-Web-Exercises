Planning out the project
	a) write out all the rules for Simple Simon in your own words with clear and simple language
		-make sure you can clearly describe the game
		-make sure you understand all the steps of playing the game
		-make sure you understand how to pass a round and how to lose the game

	b) draft the logical steps of your game using pseudo-code (BE SPECIFIC - these steps will be the beginning of your comments)
		-consider any global variables you will need to define
		-consider all functions you will need to execute processes to run the game
		-consider all events you will need to interact with the game

	c) consider what extra features you want to eventually add

	d) plan out the design or theme you eventually will create

this is like the pseudo-code stuff
"animate random square"
-generate a random number between 1-4
-use that random number along w/ jQuery selector
-"animate" - changing opacity? does the div change colors?

"play back animation sequence"
-"animate" each html element (jQuery selector) on an array

if there's functionality that both simon needs and that you need for the user's turn, that's probably a function
